1:

This graph is Bob's lambda over time graph.

After 500 iterations, the strategies looked like this:
[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
[0.         0.00521487 0.00521487 0.98957025 0.        ]
[0.15812625 0.         0.         0.         0.84187375]

You can see that Bob is underutilizing his gas. 
The cycles of lambda are really bad here. When the slope of the lambda graph is very positive, Bob is using
more gas than he should be, so the dual updates are punishing him. Here, however, we ended at a point when
the dual graph was about as negative as it gets, and we can see that that means lambda is rapidly loosening.

Step sizes here are 0.1 for primal and 0.1 for dual. So not good results, but really good demonstration of
the dynamic between the primal and dual variables, and good demonstration of what happens when you knock
over the delicate balance. Pretty cool!

Parameters for future reference:
step sizes are 0.1 for primal and 0.1 for dual
Alice gas is 16, Bob gas 5, Charlie gas 8
highway has 1/10 congestion, 2 times the gas




2:

This graph is also Bob's lambda over time graph.

Parameters: step sizes are 0.1 for both primal and dual, 520 iterations.

After 520 iterations, the strategies looked like this:
[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
[0.         0.54549013 0.         0.         0.45450987]
[0.        0.        0.9694857 0.        0.0305143]2:

Here, we ended the simulation while the lambda graph is very positive, and as predicted, Bob is using
way more gas than he should: in expectation, Bob's strategy uses 8 gas, way more than his allowed 5.

Same as 1 and 2, but with different parameters. The only thing I changed here was step size.
0.1 for primal and 0.01 for dual. We see fluctuation in mu that is less sinusoidal, but I still don't
like it, because the fluctuations are really wide, tens of iterations long. This means that the primal
has a lot of time to react and vary wildly, straying really far from the boundary of the dark regions.
Reminder that our goal here is to straddle the boundary of the dark regions.

I bet the cycles would be shorter if I actuall did the opposite and dramatically increased the dual step
size.

Here's the strategies after finishing:

[0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
[0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.  ]
[0.04515509 0.04515509 0.04515509 0.04515509 0.81937966]

Same parameters as last time, but this time I decided to graph Bob's probability of taking the highway
and lambda over the same graph. You can really see how one responds to the other!




5:

This one is great. I changed the parameters again. Step sizes are now 0.01 in primal and 10 in dual.
The huge dual steps really punish any straying from the boundary, and the small primal steps mean that
any straying from the boundary is minimal. This is shown in the graph. The sinusoidal pattern is still
there, but by adjusting step sizes, we can make the jumps very small.

The labels are bad, blame Python for that one. Purple is highway probability, and blue is lambda.
